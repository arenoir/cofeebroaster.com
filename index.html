      Nevada City's hottest coffee broaster is FoxHound Espresso, and Coffee Broaster. 
      Owned and operated by Steffen Snell, a lone survivor of the year 2000 Cyber Cafe Cyber Wars. Resurrecting the craft of Craft-batch roasted coffee, Commander Snell's ragtag team of Coffee Specialists reconfigured the formula once thought lost during the conflict, to bring about a veritable coffee renaissance. While you may just be looking for shelter from the fallout, we recommend trying a locally broasted, locally brewed to perfection coffee or espresso. 
      Your contribution to the cause is much appreciated, and necessary.

      Thank you, and fight on!
