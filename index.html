        Nevada City's hottest coffee roaster is FoxHound Espresso, and Coffee Broaster. 
        Owned and operated by Steffen Snell, a lone survivor of the year 2000 Cyber Cafe Cyber Wars. Resurrecting the craft of Craft-batch roasted coffee, Commander Snell's ragtag team of Coffee Specialists reconfigured the formula once thought lost during the conflict, to bring about a veritable coffee renaissance. While you may just be looking for shelter from the fallout, we recommend trying a locally broasted, locally brewed to perfection coffee or espresso. 
        Your contribution to the cause is much appreciated, and necessary.

        Thank you, and fight on!
